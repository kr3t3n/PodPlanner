# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a simple web application to facilitate planning and scheduling podcast episodes. The core functionality allows users to create groups (named by the creator), invite other users, manage roles (Admin vs. Member), and collaborate on podcast topics and schedules.

## 2. Objectives

1. **Group Collaboration**: Enable multiple users to join a group and collaborate on podcast episodes in a centralized place.
2. **Episode Planning**: Provide tools to schedule and plan episodes with repeating patterns.
3. **Topic Management**: Allow members to propose, comment on, and organize topics for each episode.
4. **Role-Based Control**: Grant Admins the ability to manage group details, schedules, topics, and statuses while Members have limited privileges.

## 3. Scope

- **In Scope**

  - User authentication using Replit accounts.
  - Creation and management of user groups (with a group name).
  - Role assignment within a group (Admin or Member).
  - Planning episodes via a calendar-like interface with repeat scheduling options.
  - Creation and management of a “Topics vault.”
  - Linking topics to calendar items (episodes).
  - Status management for each calendar item (Draft, Planned, Done, Deleted).
  - Basic user interface to view, add, edit, reorder, and remove items.

- **Out of Scope**

  - Payment or subscription features (the app is free).
  - Complex analytics or reporting.
  - Integration with external calendar systems (e.g., Google Calendar) at this stage.
  - Mobile app or offline capabilities beyond basic web use.

## 4. Key Features & Functionalities

1. **User Registration & Authentication**

   - Users must sign in via their **Replit** accounts.
   - Once authenticated, users can either create or join a group.

2. **Group Management**

   - **Create Group**: The user who creates the group provides the group name and automatically becomes an Admin.
   - **Change Group Name**: Any Admin can update the group name.
   - **Invite Users**: Admin can invite new users to the group by sharing an invite link or manually adding them.
   - **Role Assignment**: Admin(s) can upgrade any member to Admin status or revoke Admin privileges.
   - **Removal of Users**: Admin(s) can remove members or other admins from the group.

3. **Calendar & Scheduling**

   - **Calendar Overview**: Displays scheduled episodes.
   - **Repeating Placeholders**: Admin can create repeating episodes on a customizable schedule (e.g., every Saturday, every 5 days, last Friday of the month, etc.).
   - **Placeholder Titles**: Default title is the date string (e.g., “Feb 16, 2025 (Sunday)”), but Admin can edit it.
   - **Statuses**: Each calendar item can be labeled as Draft, Planned, Done, or Deleted. Admins can change these statuses. Episodes in Deleted status are hidden but still exist in the database.

4. **Topics Vault**

   - **Creation of Topics**: Both Admins and Members can create topics by providing at least one of:
     - **URL** (acts as the topic’s name if no name is provided).
     - **Name** (required if no URL is provided).
   - **Topic Comments**: All users can add comments to a topic. The comments are displayed in separate columns/areas per user to keep them distinct.
   - **Topic Organization**: Topics can be linked to multiple episodes. Admins can add topics from the vault to specific calendar items (episodes).
   - **Topic Visibility**:
     - **Active**: Topics are displayed in the default view.
     - **Archive**: Topics can be archived, removing them from the default view while still accessible in an Archived Topics view.
     - **Delete**: Topics can also be deleted, in which case they are hidden from all standard views but remain in the database.

5. **Topic Linking & Ordering in Episodes**

   - **Add Topics to Episodes**: Admin can attach one or more topics from the vault to any calendar item.
   - **Ordering/Reordering**: Admin can reorder topics within an episode’s schedule as needed.
   - **Removal**: Admin can remove a topic from an episode.
   - **Episode Association**: The topics vault list displays which episodes each topic is associated with.

   - All user authentication must be handled through Replit credentials. No other login mechanism is provided.
   - The app is free to use; no payment gateway or subscription model is involved.

2. **Assumptions**

   - Users have a basic understanding of a web-based collaboration tool.
   - Users with Admin role will be responsible for regular maintenance of the group, calendar, and topics.
   - The number of groups, episodes, or topics per group will remain within manageable limits (not expecting enterprise-scale usage right away).
